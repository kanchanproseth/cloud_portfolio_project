👉 Then go `set up a workflow yourself` to create your own curstom workflow

Time to put the script in `main.yml` 😈

```
name: On Website Deploy
"on":
  push:
    # (1)
    branches:
      - "develop"
jobs:
  build_and_deploy_web:
    name: Build & Deploy Flutter to Web
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # (2)
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: "stable"

      - name: 🌍 Enable Web
        run: flutter config --enable-web

      - name: 📦 Get packages
        run: flutter pub get


      - name: 🏭 Build Web Application
        run: flutter build web --release

      # (3)
      - name: Make copy of artifacts
        run: |
          chmod u+x "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/createandcopytofolder.sh"
          bash "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/createandcopytofolder.sh"
      # (4)
      - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: Commit the artifacts.
```

For your understanding

choose the branch you wanna build
```
branches:
      - "develop"
```
OS for build artifacts

`runs-on: ubuntu-latest`

this section is script for choose flutter channel and build web release

```
 # (2)
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: "stable"

      - name: 🌍 Enable Web
        run: flutter config --enable-web

      - name: 📦 Get packages
        run: flutter pub get


      - name: 🏭 Build Web Application
        run: flutter build web --release
```

this one for run the createandcopytofoler.sh script to copy artifact to the artifact folder

```
 # (3)
      - name: Make copy of artifacts
        run: |
          chmod u+x "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/createandcopytofolder.sh"
          bash "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/createandcopytofolder.sh"
```

last part of the script is called the git auto commit from mr stefanzweifel git

```
 # (4)
      - uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: Commit the artifacts.
```

you can go check his github actions and dont forget to give him a star 😁

now check in your workflow you must have main.yml and the workflow will not work yet because we need to
add the script createandcopytofolder.sh 

![alt text](https://github.com/kanchanproseth/cloud_portfolio_project/blob/develop/blogImages/3.png)

-> create the file and add the script

```
  #!/bin/bash
  [[ -d artifacts ]] && rm -r artifacts
  mkdir artifacts
  cp -R build/web artifacts
```
